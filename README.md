### Hi, I’m [Gerard](https://vaiterius.github.io) 👋

Originally a self-taught programmer, now pursuing my degree in Computer Science all while making fun and interesting projects in my free time. Most fluent in Python but easily able transition to working with other languages. Updated almost daily, I put *all* of my projects here.

- 📚 I'm a current senior at [California State University, Northridge](https://w2.csun.edu/)
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development with a focus on the back-end, but I like exploring other topics on the side!
- 🌱 I'm currently:
    - Learning front-end technologies like React
    - Web design for my university's websites
    - Sharpening data structures and algorithms skills
    - Working on several projects...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun projects, open-source, and seeking out internships along the way
- 📫 Want to reach me?: [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/354783154126716938) & [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaiterius/)
